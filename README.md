# Presence_alert_system

Security is a very important need in the daily life. In most developing regions of the world, the rate of kidnapping especially semi-urban areas has increased in recent times.
This project presents the design and prototyping of presence alert system. QR code attached to dress of child will be scanned by scanner. Information collected from QR
code will be gathered in GSM. GSM will automatically send message to corresponding registered mobile numbers and emails. The ESP32 cam is used to scan the QR code. Once an QR was detected by the ESP32 cam, GSM will send an alert SMS message or Email to registered ids. The proposed system accurately scans and inform the presence of kids in school.
